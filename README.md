# JSCombat

JSCombat is a simple two player tank combat game based on the game Combat, for the Atari 2600.

JSCombat is built using javascript, rendering onto a canvas element. The sprites come from http://chimera.labs.oreilly.com/books/1234000001654/ch04.html

One player controls the green tank, which starts on the left, and the second player controls the blue tank, which starts on the right. 

The current functionality is essentially a functional, animating 2 player combat experience.
